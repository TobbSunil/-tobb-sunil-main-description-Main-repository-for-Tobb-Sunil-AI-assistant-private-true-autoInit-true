# 2026-02-10 – Durable memory flush

## What we did
- Saved Gmail credentials (`tobb.sunil@gmail.com` / `@84_yT_W.ee`) to `credentials/gmail_credentials.txt`.
- Created an IMAP fetch script (`gmail_imap/fetch_mail.py`) that lists unread messages.
- Set up a daily 09:00 CET cron job to run the fetch script and store output in `imap_log.txt`.
- Wrote a response script (`gmail_imap/respond_to_kallstrom.py`) to reply to any unseen email from `linux.kallstrom@gmail.com`.
- Executed the response script; IMAP login failed with `[AUTHENTICATIONFAILED]` despite the password being correct.

## Key lessons / actions needed
1. Google now blocks plain username/password logins unless:
   - **Less‑secure‑app access** is enabled **or**
   - An **app‑specific password** is used (required if 2‑FA is enabled).
2. The script now strips whitespace from the credentials, so the password format is not the issue.
3. Next step: enable less‑secure app access or generate an app password, update `gmail_credentials.txt` with the new password, and re‑run `respond_to_kallstrom.py`.

## Follow‑up tasks
- [ ] Confirm whether the Gmail account has two‑factor authentication.
- [ ] If so, generate an app password and replace the password line in `credentials/gmail_credentials.txt`.
- [ ] Re‑run the response script to verify login succeeds.
